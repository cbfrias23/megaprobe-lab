####TCGAnalysis Project 

  Statistical analysis of Glioblastoma Multiforme data taken from The Cancer Genome Altas (http://cancergenome.nih.gov/), 
to compare the production of cancer cells across the individuals represented in the data. This analysis is expected to
facilitate understanding the behavior of cancer cells in the brain of a given population used in research of methods
to control or reduce the production of these cells.

	Glioblastoma Multiforme (known by the acronym GBM) is a fast-growing brain tumor, composed of a heterogeneous mixture
of poorly differentiated astrocytic tumor cells with pleomorphic, necrosis, vascular proliferation and frequent mitosis.
It can occur at any age but mainly affects adults between 45 and 70 years. It usually occurs in the cerebral hemispheres,
is less common location in the brainstem or spinal cord. Like all brain tumors, except in very rare cases, it does not
expand beyond the structures of the central nervous system.

  This project is a collaboration between [Pablo E. Vivas Mejia](http://rcmi.rcm.upr.edu/investigators/research_interest_pdf/DrPabloVivas.pdf) and [Megaprobe](http://ccom.uprrp.edu/~humberto/megaprobe/).
